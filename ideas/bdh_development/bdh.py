BDH (Binary Data Handler) Model Implementation

This module implements a neural network architecture designed for processing binary data sequences.
The model uses a transformer-like architecture with attention mechanisms to learn patterns in byte sequences.
This is useful for tasks like text generation, where we treat text as sequences of bytes.

Key concepts for ML beginners:
- Neural networks learn to predict the next item in a sequence by finding patterns in data
- Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when making predictions
- Embeddings convert discrete tokens (like bytes) into continuous vectors that the network can process

class BDHConfig:
    """
    Configuration class for the BDH model architecture.
    
    This dataclass stores all the hyperparameters (settings) that control the model's structure.
    Hyperparameters are values set before training that determine how the model learns.
    Changing these values changes the model's capacity (ability to learn) and training behavior.
    
    Attributes:
        n_layer: Number of transformer layers in the model. Each layer processes the input
                 sequentially, allowing the model to learn increasingly complex patterns.
                 More layers = more capacity but slower training and more memory usage.
                 
        n_embd: Embedding dimension - the size of vectors used to represent each byte.
                Higher values allow richer representations but require more computation.
                Think of this as how many "features" we use to describe each byte.
                
        dropout: Dropout probability - randomly sets some neurons to zero during training.
                 This prevents overfitting (memorizing training data instead of learning patterns).
                 Value between 0 (no dropout) and 1 (all neurons dropped). 0.1 means 10% are dropped.
                 
        n_head: Number of attention heads. Attention heads allow the model to focus on different
                aspects of the input simultaneously (like looking at syntax and semantics separately).
                More heads = more parallel processing but more parameters.
                
        mlp_internal_dim_multiplier: Controls the size of internal layers in the feed-forward network.
                                      This is multiplied by n_embd to determine the hidden layer size.
                                      Larger values = more capacity in the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron).
                                      
        vocab_size: Size of the vocabulary - number of unique tokens the model can process.
                    For byte-level models, this is 256 (one for each possible byte value 0-255).
                    The model learns to predict which of these 256 values comes next.

    Generate frequency values for Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE).
    
    RoPE is a technique that encodes position information directly into attention calculations.
    Instead of adding position embeddings, we rotate the query and key vectors based on their positions.
    This helps the model understand the order of elements in sequences.

    Attention is the core mechanism that allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input

    the model should pay attention to "cat" and "sat" to predict "mat" or "floor".
    
    This implementation uses RoPE, which encodes position information through rotations rather than
    addition. This is more mathematically elegant and often performs better than standard position embeddings.
    
    The attention mechanism works by:
    1. Computing how much each position should attend to every other position (attention scores)
    2. Using these scores to weight and combine the value vectors
    3. This creates a context-aware representation that considers the entire sequence

        Generate new tokens (bytes) by sampling from the model's predictions.
        
        This is the text generation process: the model predicts the next byte, we sample
        from that prediction, add it to the sequence, and repeat. This creates new sequences
        that follow patterns the model learned during training.
        
        The generation is autoregressive: each new token is based on all previous tokens.
        This is why language models can create coherent text - they consider the full context.

                         Lower temperature = more conservative, higher = more creative
